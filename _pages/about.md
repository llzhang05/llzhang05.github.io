I am Dr. Lingling Zhang, a lecturer at the School of Information Engineering, Capital Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2020. From September 2020 to July 2023, I pursued postdoctoral research at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, where I deepened my expertise in graph systems and high-performance computing.

Research Interests
======
 • Graph query and matching systems that support real-time, structure-aware ML workflows, with an emphasis on generalizability and low supervision
	
 •	Incremental and adaptive computation for evolving graphs and model serving pipelines, balancing efficiency and model accuracy
	
 •	Integration with heterogeneous hardware (e.g., CPU/GPU) for dynamic workload scheduling and energy/resource-aware deployment
	
 •	Fairness and explainability through distribution-sensitive performance profiling and selective model execution
